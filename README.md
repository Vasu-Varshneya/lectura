## üéØ Objective

Students and professionals struggle to extract and retain key information from lengthy YouTube videos, especially when preparing for exams or learning new technologies. Lectura addresses this by automating the creation of structured notes, flashcards, and practice tests with AI, enabling efficient, personalized, and multilingual learning support.

## üß† Our Approach

1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Why We Chose This Problem:*  
   As students, we struggled with NPTEL and YouTube-based learning resources‚Äîespecially during revision periods. Manually taking notes, revisiting long lectures, and preparing for exams was tedious and inefficient. We realized this wasn‚Äôt just our issue, but a common challenge for students and professionals alike, which led us to build Lectura.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Key Challenges We Addressed:*  
   We focused on eliminating manual note-taking, enabling offline access, and offering a personalized, test-driven learning experience. We also addressed the lack of real-time doubt resolution by integrating an AI chatbot that acts as a virtual tutor.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Pivots & Breakthroughs During Hacking:*  
   Initially, Lectura was only planned as a note generator. But during brainstorming, we realized the potential to extend it into a complete learning suite‚Äîwith flashcards, quizzes, and performance feedback. Adding podcast summarization and OCR support (via vision models) was a major pivot that made the platform more versatile.
